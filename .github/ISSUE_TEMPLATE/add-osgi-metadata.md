          https://github.com/osgi/osgi/issues/438

## How could this be archived

TBD: describe bnd plugin usage in this project ...

## What are the benefits

TBD: list some benefits of adding the metadata

## Do I need to change my build / development / deployment / ...

TBD: explain why adding the metadata is completely transparent and not harming "other" use-cases

## Sounds great, but I do not have any idea about OSGi

TBD: Elaborate a bit more about BND and how it automatically generates all requires stuff (for most 'library' projects).
